# Data Science Portfolio (GitHub Pages) — Starter Template

This repo is a simple, mobile-friendly portfolio site you can publish with **GitHub Pages**.
It follows the Career Prep guidance: clear navigation, strong project documentation, visuals, and links that work.

## 1) Publish with GitHub Pages (no coding needed)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Option A (recommended): **USERNAME.github.io** (gives you: https://USERNAME.github.io)
   - Option B: any name (gives you: https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME)
2. Upload this folder’s contents to the repo root (same level as `index.html`).
3. Go to: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or master) / **root**
   - Save
4. Wait for the Pages URL to appear in Settings → Pages.

## 2) What to edit first (5 minutes)
- `index.html`: your headline, short bio, featured projects
- `projects/index.html`: your project list (3–5 projects)
- `about.html`: “About me” (2–3 paragraphs) + “What I’m learning now”
- `contact.html`: email + links

## 3) Career Prep “must-haves” checklist (portfolio)
- Explain **what you did, why you did it, and what you learned**
- Keep a **clear structure**: Home / Projects / About / Contact
- Show only your best work: **quality > quantity** (aim for **3–5** projects; minimum **2**)
- Add **visual evidence**: screenshots, charts, GIFs, short Loom demo
- Keep links working (repos, demos, notebooks)
- Review on **mobile** before sharing
- Update periodically (don’t let it go stale)

## 4) Add a new project page
1. Copy: `projects/project-template.html`
2. Rename it: `projects/<your-project-slug>.html` (example: `projects/instacart-eda.html`)
3. Add it to `projects/index.html`

## 5) Add images
Put images in: `assets/img/`
Then reference them like:
`<img src="../assets/img/instacart-chart.png" alt="Instacart chart" />`

If you want, you can later migrate this to Jekyll or a theme, but this template is intentionally lightweight and fast.
